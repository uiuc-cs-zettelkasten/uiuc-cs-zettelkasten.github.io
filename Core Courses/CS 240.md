## [CS 240] Intro to Computer Systems

Basics of computer systems. Number representations, assembly/machine language, abstract models of processors (fetch/execute, memory hierarchy), processes/process control, simple memory management, file I/O and directories, network programming, usage of cloud services.

This course is offered as part of an option for CS+X students and CS minors to opt out of the 233->241 track. Instead of taking 233 and 241, CS+X students can take 240 and two 400-level courses. The first half of the class is a condensed version of 233 and 241 content. The second half of the course covers network programming and cloud services.

Prerequisities: CS 225
